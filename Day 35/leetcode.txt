Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank every day.

He starts by putting in $1 on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in $1 more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in $1 more than the previous Monday.
Given n, return the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the nth day.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 4
Output: 10
Explanation: After the 4th day, the total is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

class Solution {
public:
    int totalMoney(int n) {
        int week_count = n / 7;
        int remaining_days = n % 7;
        
        int total = ((week_count * (week_count - 1)) / 2) * 7; // Contribution from complete weeks
        total += week_count * 28; // Contribution from complete weeks (additional on Mondays)
        total += ((remaining_days * (remaining_days + 1)) / 2) + (week_count * remaining_days); // Contribution from remaining days
        
        return total;
    }
};
