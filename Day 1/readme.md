Hey, #connections I'm thrilled to share that I've completed my DAY 1 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge, and I'm already making progress. I am following a course on Data structures and algorithm in C++ , following the course today I revised some of basic key topics of c++ like data types , insertion and extraction operator, major difference between endl and /n , built in data types , using sizeof command , refrence variables , typecasting and the most important topic local and global scope . 

Although I have completed these topics but kinda revising them again through my course.I'm so glad to be taking part in this challenge and pushing myself to become a better coder. It's amazing what a little bit of focus and determination can do. I can't wait to see what the next 98 days bring!
