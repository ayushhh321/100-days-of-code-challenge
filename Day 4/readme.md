Hey, #connections I'm thrilled to share that I've completed my DAY 4 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge, and I'm already making progress. I am following a course on Data structures and algorithm in C++ , following the course today I revised the concept of pointer and the crucial part that is pointers to pointers .


Although I have solved these similar topics questions but kinda revising them again through my course.I'm so glad to be taking part in this challenge and pushing myself to become a better coder. It's amazing what a little bit of focus and determination can do. I can't wait to see what the next 96 days bring .
