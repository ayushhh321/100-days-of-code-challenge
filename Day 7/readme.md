Hey, #connections I'm thrilled to share that I've completed my DAY 7 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge, and I'm already making progress. I am following a course on Data structures and algorithm in C++ , following the course today I solved different types of question on conditional statements and also learnt why to prefer elseif over if else and why to avoid nesting .


This topic was not new for me but the question were .I'm so glad to be taking part in this challenge and pushing myself to become a better coder. It's amazing what a little bit of focus and determination can do. I can't wait to see what the next 93 days bring .
