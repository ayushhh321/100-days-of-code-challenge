The given code snippet has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the input value.

The loop iterates as long as the condition "i <= n" holds true. The variable "i" is multiplied by 2 in each iteration, starting from an initial value of 1.

Let's consider the number of iterations required to reach or exceed the value of n. At each iteration, "i" is doubled, so the loop will execute logâ‚‚(n) times before "i" exceeds n.

Therefore, the time complexity of the code is O(log n).
