Hey, #connections I'm thrilled to share that I've completed my DAY 9 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge, and I'm already making progress. I am following a course on Data structures and algorithm in C++ , following the course today I solved questiions on the topic of conditional statements . 


These topics were also not new for me but questions were.I'm so glad to be taking part in this challenge and pushing myself to become a better coder. It's amazing what a little bit of focus and determination can do. I can't wait to see what the next 91 days bring .
