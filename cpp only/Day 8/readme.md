Hey, #connections I'm thrilled to share that I've completed my DAY 8 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge, and I'm already making progress. I am following a course on Data structures and algorithm in C++ , following the course today I completed the logic of loops and why to prefer for loop over while loop or while loop over for loop also solved so many question on mixer of conditional statements and loops. 


These topics were also not new for me but questions were.I'm so glad to be taking part in this challenge and pushing myself to become a better coder. It's amazing what a little bit of focus and determination can do. I can't wait to see what the next 92 days bring .
