Hey, #connections I'm thrilled to share that I've completed my DAY 2 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge, and I'm already making progress. I am following a course on Data structures and algorithm in C++ , following the course today I revised some of basic key topics of c++ like constants , manipulators , operator precedence, control structures, if else, switch case statement , loops , for loops , while loops , do while loop , break and continue statements ,



Although I have completed these topics but kinda revising them again through my course.I'm so glad to be taking part in this challenge and pushing myself to become a better coder. It's amazing what a little bit of focus and determination can do. I can't wait to see what the next 99 days bring
